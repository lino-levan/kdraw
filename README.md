# KDraw.js

## Introduction

Welcome to KDraw.js, a lightweight javascript canvas library.

Inspired by processing.js, but designed to run quickly and natively around canvas.

KDraw is meant to be fully compatible with all 2D khanacademy projects, though there has not been enough testing to confirm that it works with everything. A future release will contain both the "khanacademy drop-in compatibility" version and the "mutli-canvas support" version.

Docs to come soon.

## Examples
